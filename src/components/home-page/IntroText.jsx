        Originally from the Netherlands and now based in England, I recently
        completed a coding bootcamp. Passionate about front-end development, I
        love creating intuitive user experiences and exploring new technologies.
        I am a hard worker eager to contribute and learn. Let&#39;s create
        something great together!
