        I&#39;m a software engineer currently working as a front-end web
        developer, rebuilding the user interface for a digital healthcare
        platform to improve user engagement. I love learning new technologies
        and using them to solve problems and create more intuitive user
        experiences. I&#39;m looking to speak with companies that value bright,
        hard work, and creative software developers.

        completed a coding bootcamp. Passionate about front&#8209;end
        development, I love creating intuitive user experiences and exploring

        Let&#39;s create something great together! */}
